# Mobile Application Development

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the Mobile Application Development course at the University of Science, VNU-HCM.

## Notes

- Week 1 is the exercise to write code in Kotlin.
- From week 2, I use Android Studio to write code so you should open the project in Android Studio.
